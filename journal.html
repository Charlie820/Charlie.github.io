<p> I started to get my person card going and linking my github to the internet. I watched a video on Khan Academy about the formats of a website, with the html, CSS, and JS sections of a webite. So far, I've only learned the html portions, but hopefully I'll be able to start designing my full website soon.</p>

<p> I may have missed a joural entry or two since my last one, but for now I have my website working and I've learned a bit more about javascript. I also learned how to do animations, so I currently have a color switching animation for the background of my website, which I might change. The animation was more or less just a quick experiment for how it works, and I might try some more things out later. </p>

<p> We had a cool class today, finally getting to how to do things with javascript. Now knowing how to manipulate variables and create divs using javascript, I feel like I'll be able to do a lot more with my projects. If I can, I'll try to use this to finsih up the code for my index and making a working chessboard. It has definitely made me available to new possibilities as I continue to move forward. Next steps would probably be to update and style my projects page, and maybe work on my index page a bit too.

<p>I worked on the whole chess thing again this weekend, since the assignment was to make a javascript codesketch. I was able to create the full board with all of the squares, and create a function that will allow pieces to be moved around. For the next step, I'll need to use event listeners to actually add the gameplay elements. I've already unsuccessfully tried to do this, but maybe I can pick up something in lab.w</p>

<p>I should really update these journal entries a lot more, but I finished the snake game in between now and the last journal entry, which I'm proud of. It introduced me to arrays and having to creatively solve some javascript problems. As I've been experimenting with javascript, I now feel comfortable with functions and variables, but the arrays are still tricky for me. </p>
